# FundMe Ethereum ðŸ’°
#### Fund Me is a decentralized app built to explore new technologies like Foundry for testing and deploying smart contracts, Wagmi/Viem for frontend development, Rainbow Kit for wallet connection, and Zustand for state management. The app allows users to connect Ethereum wallets and fund the contract which only the owner can withdraw.
#### This project aimed to learn how to deploy and write the tests in foundry and also how to read and write from the smart contract using wagmi/viem
